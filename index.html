    	What do you do when you haven't eaten breakfast or lunch and've barely snacked on anything all day, but will totally be going out for a large, lush and plentiful dinner, but damn you're hungry <strong>right now</strong>? You make some fuckin tasty ramen bro and say fuck it to that appetite the way you said fuck it to studying in college cause there was far too much partying to catch up on. Only this time you won’t regret the years wasted and massive college debt that was totally for naught because, you know, you dropped out. <strong>Welcome to Not Your Father’s Fun Episode 1 - 7/11 Gold Ippudo Tonkotsu Instant Noodles.</strong><br /><br />

		Get this; my dear friend Nattibo tells me about this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-populer-IPPUDO-instant-noodles/dp/B0147VC5LE/">7/11 Ippudo tonkotsu ramen</a>. Not only does she tell me about it, she tells me it's fucking killer shit that ~must~ be experienced. So I do what any self respecting foodie would do and ordered a case on amazon immediately. #dontjudge #itscheapertobuyinbulk<br /><br />

First thing you notice is the fancy-smancy box it comes in. None of that crinkly ass plastic almost every other ramen has. That shit gets hard to stack. This is high quality paperboard with a nicely designed aesthetic. Very classy. Ripping open the box reveals the return of crinkly ass plastic containing the noodles and a packet for the soup base.<br /><br />

Tossing a pot and an indeterminate quantity of water that I’ll just call the “feels right” amount on to the stove, I boil the life-giving liquid up and gently place in prespoke of noodles for a buck 30 on the ol’ timer. Soup packet contents having been ejected totally into a bowl without incident and absolutely not getting like an eighth of it on your hands and having to wash down that oily goodness into the sewers for some uncultured beast to consume (hey, don’t look at me like that...), we’ll add the noodles and water to the mix and stir it up all good like.<br /><br />

Because I like to class things up I chopped some scallions and tossed those on top. I’d have prepared a perfect soft-boiled egg too, but the last one left in the fridge was over a month old, and since I’m far too lazy to google the shelf/fridge life of an egg, I played it safe and did not consume month old egg. One of the few times playing it safe in life will ever pay off. <span style="font-style: italic"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Don’t wait 30 years before learning this critical lesson. Not like I’d know anything about that, Mr and/or Mrs judgey-pants.</span><br /><br />

So how do these noodles measure up, dawg?<br /><br /> 

Holy hell is this shit off the hook heavenly O_O;
Large globules of lipids greet you as you raise a spoon to your mouth, savoring your first taste of the soup’s fatty creaminess. The bliss inducing aroma wafting into your nostrils is enough to make your nose erect and rock hard (you’re welcome for that visual). And just the right amount of salt, which is a fuck-ton mind you, but not a MEGA-fuck-ton, blend perfectly into the pork flavored base that baths the angel hair thin noodles.<br /><br />

Speaking of said noodles, when cooked at the instructed minute thirty, come out a perfect mix of soft, yet springy; firm, yet giving. Much unlike the consistency of my belly, which is resoundly all give due to my lazy ass skipping the gym way too damn much and eating all these delectable carbalicious instant fun packs. #teamfat<br /><br />

All in all, massive props to 7-11 for selecting this god-tier recipe. This is among the top of the top of instant ramen I’ve eaten, and while there’s certainly a whole shit load of noodles I’ve yet to have a go at, I’m pretty confident that it’ll be some time before I find an instant pack this good.<br /><br />

Now don’t mind me while I go and buy out the remainder of the stock on Amazon...<br /><br />
